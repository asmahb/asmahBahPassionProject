        <h1>Fashion</h1>
        <p>I have a strong passion for fashion. Fashion has always caught my attention, even when I was younger. I love to see how different people choose to style different peices of clothing. In the past recent year though, modest fashion has really caught my attention. Growing up, I never really saw modest fashion beig promoted in the media. It was difficult to get inspiration, but now that modest fashion influencers are growing, it's nice to see all of the differnt ways clothes can be styled while still covering up.</p>
        <p>One of the first people that I saw that I would consider a modest fashion influencer is Aisha Adama. I saw a video about her and her style instantly drew me in. She currently has over 46k followers on instagram and posts her different outfits and outfit details. I love how she gives outfit details and how she makes outfit ideas, because it gives inspo to others who want to dress up more and still cover up. One thing that continues to inspire me today is the fact that modest fashion is still does not get enough representation. I want to make sure that people younger than me don't have to grow up worrying about getting representation on a topic they are passionate on.</p>
